# PortScanner

Python script that performs a scan of open ports on a specific IP address

Permissions must be given or the script must be run as sudo for it to work properly

Firstly it performs a quick scan of the open ports on the target IP, secondly, if there are any open ports the script displays a command to perform a deeper analysis of the open ports only
